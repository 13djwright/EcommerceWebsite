Extras TODO:

BRANDON:
-	get an actual check out working (payment billing/shipping/etc) (probably a new file)

-	add option to view account details and change account details (account.php) 

-	*implement sales statistics under manager ID (statistics.php)

DEVIN:
-	actually hash the passwords  (look into mysql hashing and php hashing)

-	*finish viewing previous orders page 

-	*set up product updates and order shipping 

-	*set up promotions via manager 

-	change each order to have a total price? (Could be calculated on the fly but it wouldnt be fun)

-	Show items in cart (maybe part of the link to Basket ((Would have to be on each page?)))

-	Make adding items to cart more noticable

-	Make a number limit on how many items can be found? (multiple pages?)
